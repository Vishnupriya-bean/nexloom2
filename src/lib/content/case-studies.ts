Their existing prototype was built on a monolithic architecture that couldn't handle concurrent users, lacked proper authentication, and had no billing integration. They needed to go from prototype to production in under 5 months to secure their next funding round.",
    solution:
      "Nexloom deployed a full-stack engineering team that redesigned the architecture using microservices with Node.js and React. We implemented multi-tenant data isolation, integrated Stripe for subscription billing, built role-based access control, and set up automated CI/CD pipelines. The team delivered iterative releases every two weeks with comprehensive testing.",

They needed to migrate to the cloud without any downtime or data loss, while maintaining strict HIPAA compliance throughout the process.",

      "Nexloom designed a phased cloud migration strategy to AWS. We implemented HIPAA-compliant VPC architecture, encrypted data at rest and in transit, set up automated backups, and created a disaster recovery plan.
